# Blazor 1 CSS Line Layout

This project was created to provide some common layouts via CSS and to show how to create and access a Blazor component library

## Why

As I move away from using a CSS framework, I noticed I use many of the same layouts, such as the default Blazor one, center for login and panels for data display.  I wanted to create a Blazor library of these so it would be easy to reuse the classes.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

   ```Command Line
   git clone https://github.com/CodingWithDavid/Blazor1lineCssLayoutLibrary
   cd Blazor1lineCssLayoutLibrary
   ```

1.	Open in Visual Studio or Visual Code
a.	With Visual Code you will need to install the C# extensions
2.	Press F5

## What's in the App

The user will be able to see 10 different layouts many with a single key css line that defines them.  They will see how to create and use a Blazor component library to access these layouts.
